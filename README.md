Dada, Javascript and HTML tutorial repository
---------------------------------------------

> To make a Dadaist poem:
> -----------------------
> *  Take a newspaper.
> *  Take a pair of scissors.
> *  Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.
> *  Cut out the article.
> *  Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in a bag.
> *  Shake it gently.
> *  Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they left the bag.
> *  Copy conscientiously.
>
> The poem will be like you.
> And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the vulgar. 

Tristan Tzara

This repository contains a series of commits that build up a javascript
"Dadaistic poem creator". The javascript follows the instructions as described by 
Tristan Tzara to take an input text and create a poem by randomly shuffling the words.

The commits are intended to teach HTML and javascript programming to beginners.
Each commit makes a small increment, starting from an empty minimal HTML page and ending
with the simple poem generator.

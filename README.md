Dada, Javascript and HTML tutorial repository
---------------------------------------------

This repository contains a series of commits that build up a javascript
"Dadaistic poem creator". The javascript follows the instructions as described by 
Tristan Tzara to take an input text and create a poem by randomly shuffling the words.

The commits are intended to teach HTML and javascript programming to beginners.
Each commit makes a small increment, starting from an empty minimal HTML page and ending
with the simple poem generator.
